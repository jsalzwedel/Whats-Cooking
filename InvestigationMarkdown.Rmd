Let's take a look at the Kaggle "What's cooking" data set.  The goal of the
competition is to predict the cuisine of a recipe based on the recipe's 
ingredients.

# Exploratory analysis

## Read in the data

The training and test files are in the json format.  This site makes a pretty
strong argument that the jsonlite library is generally the best package to use
for parsing json data:

```{r}
library(jsonlite)
file <- "train.json"
train <- fromJSON(txt=file)
```

The data.table package makes viewing data much more convenient

```{r}
library(data.table)
train <- data.table(train)
head(train,2)
```
